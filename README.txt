Mnet Network - (Pensiv LLC 2018)

The Mnet Network is a fully decentralized and distributed Cryptocurrency protocol.
The network does not use a blockchain, relying instead on a fully-decentralized 
account management architecture, where every node validates each transaction they 
wish to accept.  The simplicity of the scheme is its greatest advantage, as compexity
add exponential attack vectors in a non-hierarchical network model.

Benefits over current Cryptocurrencies:
    - Tested 15k TPS (potential for over 100k TPS with proper anycast architecture)
    - Built on completely tested and known technology (TCP/IP, DNS, gRPC, RethinkDB)
    - Tech agnostic.  The code included here is an implementation in Python of a
      possible architecture, but the underlying protocol rules are simple, and allow
      for development in any language and tech stack
    - current-State model, unlike blockchain the Mnet does not care about past
      Transactions.  Each transaction can be kept by each node or user at will, the 
      overall network only verifies the current state, meaning a much more flexible 
      data buildup and management.  Unlike blockchains, the network does not have to 
      keep the record of every single transaction since the beggining of time.
